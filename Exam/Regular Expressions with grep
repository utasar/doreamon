grep -v "pattern" file               # Invert match
grep -c "pattern" file               # Count matches
grep -n "pattern" file               # Show line numbers
grep -r "pattern" dir/               # Recursive search
grep -E "regex" file                 # Extended regex

Common Regex Patterns:

.        # Any single character
*        # Zero or more of previous
+        # One or more of previous
?        # Zero or one of previous
^        # Start of line
$        # End of line
[abc]    # Any of a, b, or c
[^abc]   # Anything except a, b, or c
[a-z]    # Any lowercase letter
[0-9]    # Any digit
|        # OR operator
()       # Grouping


Character Classes:
\d       # Digit [0-9]
\D       # Non-digit [^0-9]
\w       # Word character [A-Za-z0-9_]
\W       # Non-word character
\s       # Whitespace
\S       # Non-whitespace

Practical grep Examples:
grep "^[A-Z]" file                   # Lines starting with capital letter
grep "[0-9]$" file                   # Lines ending with digit
grep -E "[A-Z]{3}" file              # Exactly 3 uppercase letters
grep -E "^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$" file  # SSN pattern
