# CEG 2350 - Exam 1 Comprehensive Cheat Sheet

## üñ•Ô∏è **Shells & SSH**

### Shell Types
- **Windows**: PowerShell, CMD
- **Linux/Mac**: bash, sh, zsh

### SSH Commands
```bash
ssh username@hostname                  # Basic SSH connection
ssh -i ~/.ssh/private_key user@host    # SSH with specific private key
ssh-copy-id user@host                  # Copy public key to remote host


SSH Key Management:
# Key locations:
~/.ssh/id_rsa                          # Private key (MUST be 600 permissions)
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub                      # Public key
~/.ssh/authorized_keys                 # Authorized keys on remote host

# Set proper permissions:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa                # Private key - read/write owner only
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub            # Public key - readable by all
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/                      # SSH directory - owner only


üìÅ Files, Directories & OS Structure
Linux Filesystem Structure
/               # Root directory
/bin            # Essential binaries
/etc            # Configuration files
/home           # User home directories
/var            # Variable data (logs, etc.)
/tmp            # Temporary files

Essential File Commands
# Navigation & Listing
pwd                                    # Print working directory
ls -la                                 # List all files with details
cd /path                               # Change directory
cd ~                                   # Go to home directory
cd -                                   # Return to previous directory

# File Operations
cp file1 file2                         # Copy file
mv old new                             # Move/rename file
rm file                                # Remove file
rm -r directory                        # Remove directory recursively
mkdir dirname                          # Create directory
rmdir dirname                          # Remove empty directory
touch file                             # Create empty file/update timestamp

# File Viewing
cat file                               # Display entire file
head -n 10 file                        # Show first 10 lines
tail -n 10 file                        # Show last 10 lines
less file                              # View file interactively
more file                              # View file page by page

# Links
ln -s target link_name                 # Create symbolic link
ln target link_name                    # Create hard link

File Naming & Extensions
Extensions are conventions (.sh, .txt, .py)

Linux is case-sensitive (File.txt ‚â† file.txt)

Avoid special characters in filenames

üîê Ownership & Permissions

Linux Permission System
rwx rwx rwx
‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ
‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Other (world) permissions
‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îî‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Group permissions  
‚îî‚îî‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ User (owner) permissions

r = read (4)
w = write (2) 
x = execute (1)
- = no permission (0)

Permission Examples:
-rwxr-xr--   # 754: User: rwx, Group: r-x, Other: r--
drwxr-x---   # 750: Directory with these permissions
-rw-r-----   # 640: User: rw-, Group: r--, Other: ---

Permission Commands:
chmod 755 file                         # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file                         # rw-r--r--
chmod +x script.sh                     # Add execute permission
chown user:group file                  # Change owner and group
chgrp group file                       # Change group only

# Common permission patterns:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh                       # SSH directory - owner only
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa                # Private key - owner read/write
chmod 755 script.sh                    # Executable script

User & Group Management
sudo adduser username                  # Add new user
sudo deluser username                  # Delete user
sudo usermod -aG groupname username    # Add user to group
groups                                 # Show current user's groups
whoami                                 # Show current username

sudo & Root User
sudo command                          # Execute as superuser
sudo -i                               # Login as root
su -                                  # Switch to root user

‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Customization
Environment Variable
echo $HOME                            # User's home directory
echo $USER                            # Current username
echo $SHELL                           # Current shell
echo $PATH                            # Command search path

# Set environment variables:
export VARIABLE=value                 # Set for current session
export PATH=$PATH:/new/path           # Add to PATH
