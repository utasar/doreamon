ðŸ”„ I/O Streams & Redirection
Standard Streams
0 - stdin (Standard Input)

1 - stdout (Standard Output)

2 - stderr (Standard Error)

Redirection Operators:
command > file                        # Redirect stdout to file (overwrite)
command >> file                       # Redirect stdout to file (append)
command < file                        # Redirect stdin from file
command 2> error.log                  # Redirect stderr to file
command > output.log 2>&1             # Redirect both stdout and stderr
command1 | command2                   # Pipe stdout to another command
command | tee file                    # Display AND save to file


ðŸ“œ Script Execution Methods
4 Ways to Execute Scripts
source script.sh                      # Execute in current shell
. script.sh                           # Same as source

bash script.sh                        # Specify interpreter

./script.sh                           # Using shebang (requires +x permission)
# Script must start with: #!/bin/bash

script.sh                             # From any location (must be in PATH)
