File Permissions:
chmod 755 file        # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file        # rw-r--r--
chmod +x script       # Add execute permission

# Permission codes:
# 4 = read (r)
# 2 = write (w) 
# 1 = execute (x)
# 0 = no permission (-)


Process Management:
ps aux                # Show all processes
kill PID              # Terminate process
kill -9 PID           # Force kill process
top                   # Interactive process viewer


Redirection & Pipes:
command > file        # Redirect output to file (overwrite)
command >> file       # Redirect output to file (append)
command < file        # Redirect input from file
command1 | command2   # Pipe output to another command

ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls & Solutions
1. Spaces in Variable Assignment
# WRONG:
var = "value"

# CORRECT:
var="value"'

2. String vs Numeric Comparison
# Strings:
[ "$a" == "$b" ]

# Numbers:
[ $a -eq $b ]

3. File Test Conditions
# File exists and is readable:
if [ -r "$file" ]; then


4. Command Substitution
# Get output of command into variable:
files=$(ls *.txt)
count=$(wc -l < file.txt)
