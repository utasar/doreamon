**Question 7**  
Host: 12 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM | Host needs: 2 cores, 4 GB RAM | Each VM: 2 cores, 4 GB RAM  
**Answer:** 3 VMs  
*(Calculation: Available: 10 cores, 12 GB RAM. Limiting factor: RAM = 12/4 = 3 VMs)*

**Question 8**  
What technology allows/manages multiple VMs on a single physical machine?  
**Answer:** Hypervisor

**Question 9**  
Can VMs access the Internet via the host machine?  
**Answer:** True

**Question 10**  
Host: 1 TB disk | Host needs: 100 GB | Each VM: 20 GB  
**Answer:** 45 VMs  
*(Calculation: 1000 - 100 = 900 GB available → 900/20 = 45 VMs)*
